        <br /><br />Therefore, we were painfully aware of the challenges of having dozens of developers trying to agilely build independent chunks of software that communicate with each other. This talk presents our journey in developing a custom command line tool that significantly reduced the time to set up new applications while enabling us to introduce standardization seamlessly from the developers' perspective. <br />

        This talk explores how Platform Engineering can alleviate cognitive load through automation and self-service access, allowing developers to navigate complex environments without excessive friction. Leveraging metrics like DORA and SPACE to track, understand and optimize team workflows, we‚Äôll examine how to enhance DevX by minimizing interruptions and context switching.
        <br /> <br />
        We‚Äôll share concrete strategies to create cloud-native environments that simplify complexity, enabling developers to focus on what truly matters and fostering a sustainable, purpose-driven development culture."

        talk_title: "Enhancing Software Delivery: Optimizing Value Streams through DORA and Platform Engineering"
        talk_description: "In this talk, we will explore the synergy between DORA metrics, Value Stream Management (VSM), and Platform Engineering, illustrating how these frameworks collectively enhance software delivery in product-based companies. By leveraging DORA metrics‚Äîsuch as deployment frequency and lead time for changes‚Äîteams can quantitatively assess and improve their performance, aligning their efforts with business goals to ensure both speed and stability are achieved without compromise. <br /> <br />
        We will explore how VSM provides a holistic view of the software delivery process, enabling teams to identify bottlenecks and optimize the flow of value from ideation to user delivery. This approach not only reduces waste but also aligns development activities with strategic objectives, ensuring that every step adds value to the customer experience. <br /> <br />
        Furthermore, we will discuss the role of Platform Engineering in organizing development teams and tools. By implementing Internal Development Platforms (IDPs), organizations can reduce cognitive load, streamline operations, and foster a culture of collaboration. Platform Engineering standardizes workflows and tools, enabling teams to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure management.
        <br /> <br />
Drawing from Team Topologies, we will highlight the importance of socio-technical systems where collaboration and communication are paramount. This perspective emphasizes that technical excellence is intertwined with effective team dynamics and cognitive load management.
<br /> <br />
By integrating these concepts, we aim to demonstrate how high-performing teams thrive at the intersection of technology and collaboration, ultimately enhancing their ability to deliver continuous value to customers."
