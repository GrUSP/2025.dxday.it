        talk_title: "Before It Was Cool: 6 years of our Internal Developer Portal"
        talk_description: "Around 2019, we were already quite advanced in introducing microservices architecture in an effort to replace our two monolithic systems within the largest HR tech company in Central and Eastern Europe. 
        <br /><br />Therefore, we were painfully aware of the challenges of having dozens of developers trying to agilely build independent chunks of software that communicate with each other. This talk presents our journey in developing a custom command line tool that significantly reduced the time to set up new applications while enabling us to introduce standardization seamlessly from the developers' perspective. <br />
        <br />
        It will also include current alternatives and how we envision the future of our IDP"

        talk_description: "'I will remove it later after the local tests!' The last famous words, before a production secret is written, committed and pushed to a repository. 
        <br />Secret management is hard in theory, harder when following GitOps principles, and in practice it is even worse for budget limits, technical limits, knowledge limits make implementing a secure and above all usable solution a challenge. 
        <br />In this talk we will see common GitOps secret management patterns, with their pros and cons, and how they can be improved to offer a better experience to developers and infrastructure teams."
