        talk_title: "Enhancing Software Delivery: Optimizing Value Streams through DORA and Platform Engineering"
        talk_description: >-
          In this talk, we will explore the synergy between DORA metrics, Value Stream Management (VSM), and Platform Engineering, 
          illustrating how these frameworks collectively enhance software delivery in product-based companies. By leveraging DORA 
          metrics—such as deployment frequency and lead time for changes—teams can quantitatively assess and improve their performance, 
          aligning their efforts with business goals to ensure both speed and stability are achieved without compromise. <br /> <br />
          We will explore how VSM provides a holistic view of the software delivery process, enabling teams to identify bottlenecks 
          and optimize the flow of value from ideation to user delivery. This approach not only reduces waste but also aligns 
          development activities with strategic objectives, ensuring that every step adds value to the customer experience. <br /> <br />
          Furthermore, we will discuss the role of Platform Engineering in organizing development teams and tools. By implementing 
          Internal Development Platforms (IDPs), organizations can reduce cognitive load, streamline operations, and foster a culture 
          of collaboration. Platform Engineering standardizes workflows and tools, enabling teams to focus on innovation rather than 
          infrastructure management. <br /> <br />
          Drawing from Team Topologies, we will highlight the importance of socio-technical systems where collaboration and 
          communication are paramount. This perspective emphasizes that technical excellence is intertwined with effective team 
          dynamics and cognitive load management. <br /> <br />
          By integrating these concepts, we aim to demonstrate how high-performing teams thrive at the intersection of technology 
          and collaboration, ultimately enhancing their ability to deliver continuous value to customers.

        talk_description: >-
          Runbooks are the backbone of reliable incident response, but are your runbooks built to keep developers productive and 
          resilient in a 24/7 operational world? In this talk, we'll guide you through transforming runbooks into streamlined, 
          high-impact tools that both empower developers and drive productivity gains across your teams. We'll explore the critical 
          balance of detail versus simplicity, how to build runbooks as code, and why consistency and ownership are crucial for 
          alignment across DevEx and Dev Prod teams. <br /> <br />
          Covering everything from dashboards that track meaningful metrics to next-generation AI features, we'll walk through the 
          anatomy of runbooks that work - and those that don't. Learn how to craft runbooks that don't just sit idle until the next 
          incident but evolve with every touchpoint, staying relevant and impactful. <br />
          This session offers practical insights into turning runbooks into assets that save time and reduce stress, even in 
          high-stakes environments.

          This talk explores how Platform Engineering can alleviate cognitive load through automation and self-service access, 
          allowing developers to navigate complex environments without excessive friction. Leveraging metrics like DORA and SPACE 
          to track, understand and optimize team workflows, we'll examine how to enhance DevX by minimizing interruptions and 
          context switching. <br /> <br />
          We'll share concrete strategies to create cloud-native environments that simplify complexity, enabling developers to 
          focus on what truly matters and fostering a sustainable, purpose-driven development culture.

          'I will remove it later after the local tests!' The last famous words, before a production secret is written, committed 
          and pushed to a repository. <br />Secret management is hard in theory, harder when following GitOps principles, and in 
          practice it is even worse for budget limits, technical limits, knowledge limits make implementing a secure and above all 
          usable solution a challenge. <br />In this talk we will see common GitOps secret management patterns, with their pros 
          and cons, and how they can be improved to offer a better experience to developers and infrastructure teams.
